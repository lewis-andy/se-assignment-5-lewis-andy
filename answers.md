6. Integrated Terminal:
    - The integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code allows users to run command-line tools and scripts without
   leaving the editor. It can be opened by pressing `Ctrl+`` or `Cmd+`` on macOS. 
   Some advantages of using the integrated terminal compared to an external terminal include:
      - Seamless integration with the editor for a unified coding experience.
      - Easy access to terminal commands without switching between applications.
      - Ability to split the terminal into multiple panes for multitasking.
